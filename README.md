# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to dive into the kickstarter data in order to optimize our own kickstarter campaign. We wanted to look at what made a campaign successful or a failure and why to improve our chance at creating a successful campaign

## Analysis and Challenges
We analyzed mainly the dates of the kickstarter campaigns and the amount of money involved in each campaign. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

What we learned from our chart on launch dates is that campaigns started around may or june were more likely to be successful. This is likely due to may and june not having any major holidays. This could lead to people having more spending money and thus being more willing to spend money on luxuries such as kickstarter campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This chart shows you are far more likely to succeed in your campaign if you have a lower goal. However once you get to a certain threshold there seems to be no corrolation in the data. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges I encountered was learning how pivot tables were made. Specifically understanding values and rows and columns. Figuring out how to optimize the way you create pivot tables was tricky but I learned to manage them.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns started around may or june are more likely to succeed.
Campaigns are more likely to succeed if started around times when people have more spending money.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
If we want to make a campaign having a smaller goal tends to give us better chances of succeeding.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is from a couple years ago and may not accurately represent the current day.
More specific classifications for categories would help us more accurately find the campaigns we want to analyze.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Outcomes based on spotlight would help us understand if getting spotlit is more important than any other factor.
Outcome based on staff pick for the same reason as above.
