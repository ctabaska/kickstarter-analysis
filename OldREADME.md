# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## What did we learn from this data?
Many campaigns failed due to an inflated goal for what the product was.

### Outcome Based on Date Created
In the graph below is a summary of how many campaigns were started and what time of the year it was started.

What we can see here is that people are more likely to contribute to a campagn in May or June likely to it not being around any major holidays in which people are likely to not have as much spending money. 

### Parent Category Outcome
In this graph we attempted to check how theater campaigns compare to other categories

In our dataset we could see that the biggest category was theater. Looking at the graph we can see that most of the campaigns succeeded but not all. In fact compared to other categories it had close to a 1:1 ratio of succeeded to failed. Based on that, it's very important for us to look at why and how they succeeded.

## How can we use this data for our own campaign?
* If louise wants to create a successful campaign they would need to provide a reasonably attainable goal that still covers the budget of the product they are trying to create.
* Focusing on creating our campaign at an optimal time when people are more likely to have money to spend on a kickstarter campaign can help us be more successful.
* We can take a deep analysis of specific campaigns that went over their goal and what about them was appealing to the consumer.
